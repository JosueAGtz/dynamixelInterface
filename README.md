# Dynamixel Interface
The Dynamixel Interface is a board that allows easy communication with an MCU or Processor with a simple UART module, the board integrates a voltage level converter and a Tri-state buffer to accomplish good communication between a Dynamixel servomotor and almost any microcontroller in the market. The board is breadboard-friendly and development-ready as the connection pins are 0.1" standard pitch and the castellated holes for SMD mounting.
