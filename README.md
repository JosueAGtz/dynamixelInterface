# Dynamixel Interface
The Dynamixel Interface is a board that allows easy communication with a MCU or Processor with a simple UART module, the board integrates a voltage level converter and a Tri-state buffer to accomplish a good communication between a Dynamixel servomotor and almost any microcontroller in the market.The board is breadboard friendly and development ready as the connection pins are 0.1" standard pitch and the castellated holes for SMD mounting.
